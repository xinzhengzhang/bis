# Change Log

## [Unreleased]
### 0.3.2
Note that this version must be upgraded together with the rules

Features
* Add support for ios_unit_test (logic test without test_host)
* Add support for ios_unit_test (app test with test_host)

**Important**
* For logical tests, the architecture of the testbundle must be consistent with the current environment architecture. If you are under apple silicon, the default simulator architecture is `ios_x86_64`, which is conflict with silicon please modify `bis.simulator_cpu_string` to `ios_sim_arm64`

### 0.3.1
* Add `bazel run ${target} in task provider`
* Fix type of rolling size in configuration
* Correct README.md

### 0.3.0
This is a major release that almost refactored all rules and expanded the scope from iOS to all C-family(include swift) platforms.

UI
* Added platform options and select appropriate rules based on the platform
* Added tree viewer and provided sub-target compilation and index dependency building
Features
* Added multiple rules prompt for target selector
iOS
* Updated ios-deploy to main version for preventing stuck in install process
Debugger
* Add support for binaries macos_application|macos_command_line_application|cc_binary|swift_binary|apple_universal_binary|cc_test
* Add support for library cc_libray|objc_library|swift_library
Rules
* Refactored build rules using aspects

**Important**
* There is a breaking change for all rules, please update bis_rules to the specified version (0.3.0)
* There is a breaking change for all rules, we recommanded to delete the `.bis/BUILD` or update it by `Generate launch.json`

### 0.2.8
Fix
* Fix bad path handling logic

### 0.2.7
Fix
* Refresh tree viewer command not working
* Default behavior without file_path

Enhance
* Add icon for cell in tree viewer

### 0.2.6
Features
* Add tree viewer
* Modify the way you compile sublibraries from independent compile to share the same configuration of the root target. This makes it possible to share the cache

** Note that this upgrade must be synchronized with rules **
### 0.2.5
* Greatly accelerate the speed of generating swift dependencies for index dependencies and removed the `bis.prebuild_swift_when_indexing` configuration because it was fast enough
* Greatly optimize the range of finding compile instructions

### 0.2.4
* Index hints for headers are supported. Please be sure to upgrade the matching rules to 0.2.4, otherwise the index header may cause long waits

### 0.2.3
Revert
* 0.2.1 Most projects will have package problem exceptions, and using too strict cquery will cause the problem of not being able to query. If you use bzlmod, add query `--enable_bzlmod` in the bazelrc of the project

### 0.2.2
Enhance
* Use smaller granularity to detect if bis is in the project

### 0.2.1
Enhance
* Since bazel query has not yet supported bzlmod, most of the implementations have been modified to cquery

### 0.2.0
Features
* Compatible with [InjectionIII](https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionIII)
* Add setting `bis.auto_refresh_dummy_project_for_InjectionIII` for auto refreshing compile commands used by hot reload

Commands
* Add `zxz-moe-bis.refreshDummyProjectForInjectionIII` for refreshing dummy project and compile commands used by hotreload

Enhance
* Optimize the logic of detecting whether it is a bis project
* Using poll targetSDK to achieve the purpose of observation

### 0.1.8
* Add configuration `target_query_kind_filter` for specifying rules kind which will be queried in target selection

### 0.1.7
Features
* Add configuration `query_kind_filter` for specifying rules kind which will be queried
* In order to prevent intrusion into other bazel projects only start to set the cpu strings after the bis rules are detected

Thanks

### 0.1.6
Features
* Copy target path from BUILD file
* Show target dependencies
* Specify WORKSPACE(bazel) root on demand

### 0.1.5
Features
* Add option `bis.startup_options`
    
    Customize bazel startup options
    like `custom.bazelrc`
### 0.1.4
Features
* Redesign bis.auto_generate_launch_json

    Now the default value is `true`

    The flag meaning is changing to automatically update launch.json when the configuration changes. (build_target, compilation_mode, host_target)
* Inputer: query all ios_application as potential options

Changes
* Remove error prone flag `bazel_background_output_base`

### 0.1.3
Features:
* support extension `[".swift", ".m", ".mm", ".c", ".cc", ".cpp", ".cxx", ".c++", ".C", ".CC", ".CPP", ".CXX", ".C++"]`

### 0.1.2
Features
* bis.check_duplicate_compile_commands

    Whether to ignore repeated refresh commands.

    Note: Different compilation parameters will still reuse the same copy. It doesn't matter in most cases, you can choose to delete the local ./compile_commands.json or disable it

### 0.1.1 
* Add much more log

### 0.1.0
* Remove pre_launch_task_name in setup.py set it to `$${config:bis.pre_launch_task_name}`

### 0.0.10
* Set last value into inputer when clicked
* Do not display logs when refreshing commands
* bis.bazel_background_output_base set to '' to disable background refreshing

### 0.0.9
* Fix that UI overlaps each other when extract build target and pre build task
* Show error if file not in target's dependencies
* Adapt to multiple workspaces

### 0.0.8
* minor update

### 0.0.7
* Differentiate target between ios with others and set the correct configuration to it for sharing the build cache
* Auto provides build task that are depended on the build target (Try `command + shift + b`)

### 0.0.6
* Fix target path validation in inputer
* Change validationSeverity from Error to Warning

### 0.0.5
Optimization
* Speed up the generation of launch.json
* Change default action in iosTarget from `select` to `last-selected`
* Change default value of simulator cpu from `""` to `"ios_x86_64"`

Features:
* Add some extension settings
    1. Custom pre launch task name
    2. Custom build options append on `bazel build`
* Automatic merge of `compile_commands.json`
    * Default rolling size is `300000000`
    * Set it to `0` turn off the automatic merge

### 0.0.4
Features:
* Support background refreshing

### 0.0.3
* fix wrong registation

### 0.0.2
* Change activationEvents to `workspaceContains:WORKSPACE`
* Change bis.auto_generate_launch_json default value to `false`
* Filter supported file extension(.m | .swift | .mm) for refreshing `compile_commands`.json
    * Since most projects use modules, most of them cannot find the inputs containt '.h'. So for the header file it is recommended to build an index by directly including his source fileï¼ˆ.m & .mm)
### 0.0.1
* Initial release
